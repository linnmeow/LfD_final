# LfD_final

Linnnn 17.10: added data visualizer class, rn it doesnt do much and the results of the visualizations do not say much (a lot of "user"). But good to know is that we have 8000/4000 not offensive (labeled as NOT) and offensive tweets (labeled as OFF) in our training set respectively. And 700/350 in dev set.

I need to do preprocessing tmw and prob add more visulization tools. But it was a good start for meeeeeee.


Linnnn 18.10: added data preprocessor (removes @USER and URL, punctuation, remove numbers, convert emojis to text)
